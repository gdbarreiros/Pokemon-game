# pokemon-game
This is a repository about a small project that I've developed during the class MAC0115 - Introdução à Computação para Ciências Exatas e Tecnologia. The objective was to create a pokemon game using some cinematic formulas from physics and the main data types in Python. 

There are three distinct scripts, each one with a different level of complexity. The last one, v3, is the final version of the project. If you want, you can run it in your computer and have some fun!
